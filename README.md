## 🐍💻 Welcome to My Digital Tomb — I’m Omar

🧑‍💻 **Penetration Tester | Red Team Enthusiast | Cyber Gladiator from Egypt 🇪🇬**

I’m a cybersecurity engineer with a foundation in computer engineering and a passion for discovering how systems work — inside and out. I love exploring architectures, breaking things down, and building my own tools from scratch to automate, exploit, or defend.

⚔️ Currently mastering SOC Tier 1 operations while staying deep in red team tactics. I thrive in CTFs, enjoy offensive security challenges, and love creating my own hacking utilities instead of just using what’s already out there.

### 🧠 What I Bring to the Table:
- 🔧 Strong coding background — Python, Bash, and crafting custom tools
- 📟 Deep knowledge of computer systems, hardware, architecture & OS internals
- 🧪 Always building — from scanners to exploit scripts to mini C2s
- 🕵️ Curious by nature — I love discovering, breaking, and rebuilding systems
- 🎯 Active in CTFs and red-vs-blue competitions, always thinking like an attacker
