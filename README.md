## 🐍💻 Welcome to My Digital Tomb — I’m Omar

🧑‍💻 **Penetration Tester | Red Team Enthusiast | Cyber Gladiator from Egypt 🇪🇬**

I'm a cybersecurity engineer blending deep technical knowledge with a hands-on offensive mindset. From breaking systems at the hardware level to crafting encrypted comms and stealthy data transfer tools, I build tech that pushes boundaries.

⚔️ I sharpen my skills as a SOC Tier 1 analyst, but my core is red team driven: designing tools, scripting offensive workflows, and dissecting systems to understand their pulse.

### 🧠 What I Bring to the Table

- 🔧 **Master of Code and Scripting**  
  With a strong programming foundation in Python, Bash, and custom scripts, I craft seamless, efficient tools that turn complex problems into elegant solutions. From automating routine tasks to exploiting vulnerabilities, my code speaks for itself.

- 📟 **Hardware Whisperer & OS Architect**  
  With a deep understanding of computer engineering, hardware architecture, and OS internals, I don’t just break systems—I understand their pulse, making me a true systems-level hacker. My hands-on experience with low-level exploits and hardware hacking makes me a versatile tech tactician.

- 🧩 **CTF Enthusiast & Red Team Operator**  
  A constant player in CTFs and hack-and-defend competitions, I stay sharp by tackling real-world attack and defense scenarios. Whether it's designing offensive strategies or fine-tuning defensive measures, I always look for new ways to outsmart adversaries in the cybersecurity domain.

- 🔐 **Security Automation and Optimization**  
  Constantly striving to automate repetitive processes, secure systems at the core, and outsmart attackers, I focus on improving security through innovation and custom solutions. I don’t just defend systems—I preemptively design them to be unbreakable.

## ⚒️ Custom Tools I’ve Built

Here are some personal tools I’m actively developing to enhance my workflow, red team tactics, and secure operations:

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Encrypted Team Comms Channel**  
  A secure, encrypted communication system inspired by covert ops. Built for stealthy team coordination in high-threat environments.

- 📡 **High-Security Data Transfer Utility**  
  A stealth-focused tool for secure data transfer using layered encryption and obfuscation. Adapted from C2 exfil concepts for daily lab use.

- 🧰 **Custom Recon and Payload Toolkit** *(coming soon)*  
  A modular suite for automated recon, info gathering, and light post-exploitation tasks, optimized for speed and stealth.

> ⚙️ These tools are built from scratch, tested in my lab, and designed for real-world use — no copy-paste junk.

## 📚 My Cybersecurity Learning Journey

I’m constantly leveling up my skills through structured learning and hands-on projects. Below is my current focus:

- **Mastering the Python `os` Library**  
  I’m diving deep into the `os` module to automate file system tasks, manage processes, and build robust tools. Check out my [Python `os` Learning Guide](https://github.com/MOmar990/Cybersecurity-Learning/blob/main/os_learning_guide.md) for a step-by-step breakdown of my progress.

- **6-Week Python Hacking Curriculum**  
  I’m following a custom 6-week plan to build hacking tools, from port scanners to keyloggers. See the full curriculum and resources in my [Python Hacking Curriculum](https://github.com/MOmar990/Cybersecurity-Learning/blob/main/python_hacking_curriculum.md) and [Learning Plan](https://github.com/MOmar990/Cybersecurity-Learning/blob/main/python_hacking_learning_plan.md).

**Recent Projects**:
- Built a port scanner and banner grabber using `socket` (Week 1).
- Developing an ARP spoofing tool with `scapy` (Week 2).
- Working on a login brute forcer with `requests` (Week 3).
