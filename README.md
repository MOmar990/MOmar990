## 🐍💻 Welcome to My Digital Tomb — I’m Omar

🧑‍💻 **Penetration Tester | Red Team Enthusiast | Cyber Gladiator from Egypt 🇪🇬**

I'm a cybersecurity engineer blending deep technical knowledge with a hands-on offensive mindset. From breaking down systems at the hardware level to building my own encrypted comms and stealthy data transfer tools — I create the kind of tech I wish existed.

⚔️ I currently sharpen my skills in SOC Tier 1 operations, but my core is red team driven: I design tools, script offensive workflows, and challenge systems just to understand how they tick.

## ⚒️ Some of the Custom Tools I'd made:

Here are a few personal tools I’m actively developing to enhance my workflow, red team tactics, and secure internal operations:

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Encrypted Team Comms Channel**  
  A secure, encrypted communication system inspired by covert dark web ops. Built to enable stealthy team coordination in isolated or high-threat environments.

- 📡 **High-Security Data Transfer Utility**  
  A stealth-focused tool to securely move data between devices using layered encryption and modern obfuscation techniques. Originally made for victim-to-C2 exfil, now adapted for daily secure data handling in my lab.

- 🧰 **Custom Recon and Payload Toolkit** *(coming soon)*  
  A modular suite of scanning and payload tools to automate recon, info gathering, and light post-exploitation tasks — tailored for speed and stealth.

> ⚙️ These tools are built from scratch, tested in my own lab environments, and designed for real-world use — no copy-paste junk.
